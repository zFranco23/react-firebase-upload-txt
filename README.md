# React firebase upload txt sample

Simple multiple document uploads using two approaches: Single upload and Batch upload.

No deps.

The logic is really simple.It is based on reading the .txt file line by line, convert into an schema and upload to firebase. 

STEPS TO FOLLOW:
1.    Get your credentials in firebase [https://firebase.google.com](https://firebase.google.com)
2.    Replace your credentials in **.env.template** and rename it to **.env**

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.


### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
